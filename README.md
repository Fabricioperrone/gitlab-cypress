# GitLab Cypress

Sample project to experiment with [Cypress](https://cypress.io) for testing the GitLab application.

## Pre-requirements

You need to have a GitLab local environment such as [GDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit) or Docker up and running.

You also need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed on your computer.

For this project, the following versions of node and npm were used:

```sh
$ node -v
v18.13.0

$ npm -v
8.19.3
```

### Running GitLab on Docker

Run `docker run --publish 80:80 --name gitlab --hostname localhost wlsf82/gitlab-ce` and wait for the environment to be up and running (this might take a minute or so), then access http://localhost/, and finally, create a password for the `root` user.

## Installation

Run `npm i` to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

> Before running the tests, create a file called `cypress.env.json` in the project root directory, based on the [`cypress.env.example.json`](./cypress.env.example.json) file, and update the value of the `user_password` property with the credentials of the `root` user.
>
> After that, log into your local GitLab environment and create an access token with the `api` scope, and then, in the `cypress.env.json` file, in the property called `gitlab_access_token`, update its value with the just created token. This token will be used by most of the tests.
>
> An easy way to create this token is to simply run the test `cypress/e2e/gui/createAccessToken.spec.js` in interactive mode (see below for instructions), and use the automatically created token to update the `cypress.env.json` file.
>
> By default, the tests will run against `http://localhos/`, but if you need to run them in a different URL (e.g.: `http://localhos:3000/`), change the `baseUrl` property in the `cypress.config.js` file.

### Headless mode

Run `npm t` to run all tests in headless mode.

Run `npm run test:api` to run only the API tests in headless mode.

And run `npm run test:gui` to run only the GUI tests in headless mode.

### Interactive mode

1. Run `npm run cy:open` to open the Cypress App
2. Select E2E Testing
3. Select one of the available browsers (e.g., Electron), and click the Start button
4. Finally, click on the test file you want to run and wait for it to finish.
